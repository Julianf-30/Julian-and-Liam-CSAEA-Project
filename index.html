    <h1>Basic Rules of Chess</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>White starts and then black goes.</li>
        <li>The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent</li>
        <li>Running out of time results in a loss</li>
        <li>You can offer a draw to your opponent</li>
        <li>When you are white, queen gets the light square and the black queen gets the dark square</li>
        <li>Pawns that reach the end of the board must promote to any other piece- even if the piece has already been captured</li>
