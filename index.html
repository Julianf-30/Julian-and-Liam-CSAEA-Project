    <h1>Basic Rules of Chess</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>White starts and then black goes.</li>
        <li>The goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent</li>
        <li>Running out of time results in a loss</li>
        <li>You can offer a draw to your opponent</li>
        <li>When you are white, queen gets the light square and the black queen gets the dark square</li>
        <li>Pawns that reach the end of the board must promote to any other piece- even if the piece has already been captured</li>

    <h1>Parts of a chess game</h1>
    <h2>The Opening</h2>
    <p class="parts">The parts of a chess game are the opening, middle game, and end game. There are tactics for all three. 
    For starters, there are different types of openings. Some of them include: The Caro Kann, King's pawn, Queen's pawn, and Sicillian.
    The goal of the opening is to develop all of your pieces and get them off of their starting squares. You could also play a gambit. 
    A gambit is when you sacrifice material for long term gain like a better position, or the idea of winning it back later with more gain.
    Gambits can be risky though, so they are not always played. </p>
    <br><h2>The Middle Game</h2>
    <p class = "parts">
        During the middle game, the goal is to try and take advantage of your postion and your opponents postion. This is where you make trades,
        (capturing your oppenents piece for the price of a piece the same value). This is also where you try and attack your opponent with strategies.
        The middle game should set you up for a good end game, if played correctly. There is a saying that goes: "The perfect game of chess ends in a draw". 
    </p>
    <br><h2>The End Game</h2>
    <p class="parts">
        During an endgame, you and your opponent will typically have not a lot of pieces, and one person usually has more. This is where pawn promotion can come into play.
        It is also where the winning player tries to checkmate their opponent and the losing player will try to defend, or flip the position to their advantage.
        Anything can happen during an end game, so your strategies need to be strong. Stalemate also happens during an end game. Stalemate is when the position is a draw because
        your king or your opponents king has no squares to move to. Be careful of this when going for checkmate.
